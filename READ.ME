Sustainable Development Goal (SDG): Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production
Specific Problem: Promoting sustainability in supply chains by tracking and analyzing supplier practices, resource usage, and waste management.

Data-Driven Solution Overview
Objectives:
Track sustainability metrics of suppliers.
Analyze data to identify opportunities for improvement.
Visualize data to aid decision-making.
Step 1: Design and Implement a Relational Database
Database Schema
Tables:

Suppliers

SupplierID (Primary Key)
Name
Location
ContactInfo
Products

ProductID (Primary Key)
SupplierID (Foreign Key)
ProductName
Category
EnvironmentalImpact (e.g., CO2 emissions, water usage)
SustainabilityMetrics

MetricID (Primary Key)
SupplierID (Foreign Key)
Year
WasteGenerated
EnergyConsumption
WaterUsage
CertificationStatus (e.g., ISO 14001)
Relationships:

Suppliers to Products: One-to-Many (a supplier can provide multiple products).
Suppliers to SustainabilityMetrics: One-to-Many (a supplier can have multiple years of sustainability metrics).
Step 2: Write SQL Queries to Retrieve and Analyze Data
Retrieve all suppliers with their sustainability metrics:

sql
Copy code
SELECT s.Name, sm.Year, sm.WasteGenerated, sm.EnergyConsumption, sm.WaterUsage
FROM Suppliers s
JOIN SustainabilityMetrics sm ON s.SupplierID = sm.SupplierID;
Identify suppliers with the highest waste generation:

sql
Copy code
SELECT s.Name, SUM(sm.WasteGenerated) AS TotalWaste
FROM Suppliers s
JOIN SustainabilityMetrics sm ON s.SupplierID = sm.SupplierID
GROUP BY s.Name
ORDER BY TotalWaste DESC;
Analyze average energy consumption per category of products:

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.Category, AVG(sm.EnergyConsumption) AS AvgEnergyConsumption
FROM Products p
JOIN SustainabilityMetrics sm ON p.SupplierID = sm.SupplierID
GROUP BY p.Category;
Step 3: Use Microsoft Excel for Data Visualization and Analysis
Data Import:

Import the results of SQL queries into Excel for visualization.
Create Visualizations:

Bar Chart: Show total waste generated by each supplier.
Pie Chart: Display the proportion of average energy consumption by product category.
Line Graph: Track sustainability metrics over years for a selected supplier.
Analysis Tools:

Use PivotTables to analyze and summarize data.
Implement Excelâ€™s filtering and sorting features to explore different aspects of the data easily.
Conclusion
By designing this database and using SQL queries alongside Excel for visualization, you can effectively track and promote sustainability in supply chains. This solution not only addresses the specific problem but also facilitates data-driven decision-making, contributing to more responsible consumption and production practices.
